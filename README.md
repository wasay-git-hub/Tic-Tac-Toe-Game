# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Project Overview
This project is a **simple Tic Tac Toe game** designed to practice and demonstrate **JavaScript concepts**, including **events** and **promises**, along with an interactive **GUI** built with HTML and CSS. It allows two players to play the classic game directly in the browser.

## Features
- Interactive 3x3 game board.
- Two-player mode with turn-based gameplay.
- Event-driven updates for smooth interactivity.
- Promises used to handle game flow logic.
- Simple and responsive design with CSS.

## File Structure
- `index.html` – Main HTML file containing the game structure.
- `style.css` – CSS file for styling the game board and UI.
- `game.js` – JavaScript file handling game logic, events, and promises.

## Tools & Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Browser-based interface

## How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Two players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their symbol (X or O).
3. The game announces the winner or a draw once the board is filled.
4. Use the "Restart" button to play again.

## Learning Outcomes
- Practiced DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.
- Implemented game logic using promises to manage asynchronous actions.
- Built a visually interactive interface using CSS styling.
- Gained experience structuring small web projects with separate HTML, CSS, and JS files.
